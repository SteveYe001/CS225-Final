## **Team Contract**   **(rongw4-yiyanz3-ruoliu2-yongy2)**


### Communication
1. **Team Meeting** 
Our team will meet at least twice a week every Tuesday and Saturday from 5-7 PM using Zoom. If the task is really hard, we plan to meet in person in Granger Library. There will be zoom transcribe every meeting. There will be a member appointed for documenting the progress we make every week. 
2. **Assistance**
Assistance Each team member can be contacted through email, Discord(email and Discord are mainly used to communicate with tutor), or Wechat. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 2 hours. 
3. **Respect** 
Every week a team member will be appointed to be the note-taker. The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting and he will also be responsible for negotiating, like a central server. Howerver, team members are also encouraged to talk with each other directly. The role of note taker is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them. 

### Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution**
Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined by the full team and the note-taker will assign the task to team members. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis and the specific team members will talk over them privately. 
2. **Time Commitment**
To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than eight and no more than twenty hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is not only the team’s responsibility, but also the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. When team members confront the unexcepted problems that they can't work out, they can ask other team member for help to ensure the task completed on time.
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members. 
3. **Conflict Resolution**
When a conflict happenes, the note-taker of the week, who is also the temporary leader, will decide to take whose opinion. If there is really a hard time to make a decision, the note-taker should hold a vote. If the votes are balanced, then the opinion from supervisor(TA) should be taken.
